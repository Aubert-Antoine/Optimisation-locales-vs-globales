## Folder Structure

The workspace contains three folders by default, where:

- `src`:            the folder to maintain sources
- `csv`:            the folder to contain data
- `histogramme`:    the folder to contain histogramme


> The `src>main` class contain the 'main()' fonction of the project.

## info

There are 2 booleans, "debug" and "info" which give a text output if they are true.

## execution 
### csv 
- `Main.java -> main()`
The csv files are then all saved in the optimisation-locales-vs-globales/csv folder

### Histogramme
In cmd : 
- `cd path/optimisation-locales-vs-globales`
- `python src/histogramme.py " 'CLASS NAME'.csv "`

The .jpg histograms are then all saved in the optimisation-locales-vs-globales/histogram folder
